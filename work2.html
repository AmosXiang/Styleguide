                    An immersive educational simulation that create the experience of an earthquake scenario.
                    Our project provides different form of intuitive interaction between the user and the scene.
                    Aimed to aid the annual ShakeOut BC drill for people to experience a simulated
                    earthquake environment to practice and get prepared in case of the real Earthquake.

                    T-rex, this is one of the dinosaur inside the Jurassic world environment that we wish to create.
                    We aim to make this intimidating and it will act almost like a antagonist to the panda.
                    The teeth of the T-rex will be made as it will be in one of the important shot in the ending of the
                    plot.

                <div class="content">
                    The environment of our story starts inside a bamboo forest which will consist of lots of bamboo
                    trees with
                    different levels of plains and small roads. Inside this environment, there will be different kind of
                    species
                    inhabited: Rabbits, butterfly and birds. It will be a sunny day and the sky will be blue.
                    <br /><br />
                    Another environment we have is the Jurassic world. In this environment, dinosaurs will inhabit this
                    environment
                    and the sky will be yellowish. The environment also consists of lots of gigantic plantations that
                    fit the
                    environment. Ground will be rock and dirt like color that represent the time period.

                    <h4>Modeling & Texturing</h4>
                    Modeling with the reference image, I intentionally built model with rectangle frames so that I can
                    animate it easier. During the model making process, one of the most common problem would be
                    extruding
                    multiple times on the same edge without realizing and when smoothing the model later on. The model
                    was
                    not what we expected and we had to go through a somewhat time-consuming period to fix the model.

                <h3>Rigging & Animating</h3>
                During rigging process, one of the most frustrating problem I encounter is that the skeleton and the
                mesh
                always disconnected whenever we carry the model to a different computer.
                <br />
                In the animation stage, we didn't have much issue in this stage except that the file size was too big
                which
                result us to use playblast to see the animation every time we make some changes. This was very time
                consuming which result in some of the animation not as smooth as we want them to be.

                <h3> Issues </h3>
                The camera shake we first implemented for simulating the earthquake scene was causing motion sickness to
                our
                playtesters. 2D GUI is also not appearing on the oculus to provide any information.

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Workarounds, solutions</h3>
                Use animation to animate the whole scene to shake and add rigid-body to each component in the scene to
                make
                them react to the “physics” during the earthquake scenario. We also made 3D text and glowing signs to
                guide the
                player around the scenes.
