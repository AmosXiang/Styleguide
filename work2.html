            The panda will be the protagonist of the story.
            We aim to make it a more realistic version of the animal and during the story,
            the panda will lead the views eye throughout the event.

            T-rex, this is one of the dinosaur inside the Jurassic world environment that we wish to create.
            We aim to make this intimidating and it will act almost like a antagonist to the panda.
            The teeth of the T-rex will be made as it will be in one of the important shot in the ending of the plot.

        <h4>Environment</h4>
        The environment of our story starts inside a bamboo forest which will consist of lots of bamboo trees with
        different levels of plains and small roads. Inside this environment, there will be different kind of species
        inhabited: Rabbits, butterfly and birds. It will be a sunny day and the sky will be blue.
        <br /><br />
        Another environment we have is the Jurassic world. In this environment, dinosaurs will inhabit this environment
        and the sky will be yellowish. The environment also consists of lots of gigantic plantations that fit the
        environment. Ground will be rock and dirt like color that represent the time period.

                <h4>Modeling & Texturing</h4>
                Modeling with the reference image, I intentionally built model with rectangle frames so that I can
                animate it easier. During the model making process, one of the most common problem would be extruding
                multiple times on the same edge without realizing and when smoothing the model later on. The model was
                not what we expected and we had to go through a somewhat time-consuming period to fix the model.

            <h4>Rigging & Animating</h4>
            During rigging process, one of the most frustrating problem I encounter is that the skeleton and the mesh
            always disconnected whenever we carry the model to a different computer.
            <br />
            In the animation stage, we didn't have much issue in this stage except that the file size was too big which
            result us to use playblast to see the animation every time we make some changes. This was very time
            consuming which result in some of the animation not as smooth as we want them to be.
