                <div class="content">
                    An immersive educational simulation that create the experience of an earthquake scenario.
                    Our project provides different form of intuitive interaction between the user and the scene.
                    Aimed to aid the annual ShakeOut BC drill for people to experience a simulated
                    earthquake environment to practice and get prepared in case of the real Earthquake.

                <h3>3D GUI</h3>
                <div class="content">
                    We made the decision to guide audiences in an immersive way that creating a 3D space for them to
                    explore.
                    Following with the arrow and instructions, the audience get familiar with the basic operations.
                    The guide light will lead the audience to the correct position for stepping into the next scene.

                <div class="content">
                    Passing through the guide scene, the audience enters a house and he/she will be guide to the table.
                    A VR helmet on the table will bring the audience to another VR game.
                    The audience was forced to exist the game and a breaking new pop up to claim that the earthquake is
                    coming.

                    The audience was guide through the instructions on the wall as well to learn about how to save
                    his/her life
                    during an earthquake.

                <div class="content">
                    When the earthquake ends, the audience needs to find a flashlight in order to find the key in the
                    dark
                    environment. As the audience found the key, he/she can escape the house by following the guide
                    light.

                <h3> Issues </h3>
                The camera shake we first implemented for simulating the earthquake scene was causing motion sickness to
                our
                playtesters. 2D GUI is also not appearing on the oculus to provide any information.

                <h3>Workarounds, solutions</h3>
                Use animation to animate the whole scene to shake and add rigid-body to each component in the scene to
                make
                them react to the “physics” during the earthquake scenario. We also made 3D text and glowing signs to
                guide the
                player around the scenes.

                The event was welcoming to everyone that cross-by and would like to experience virtual reality. Our team
                is
                happy to see so many people are willing to participate our user study and test our project.
