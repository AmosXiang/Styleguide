            An immersive educational simulation that create the experience of an earthquake scenario.
            Our project provides different form of intuitive interaction between the user and the scene.
            Aimed to aid the annual ShakeOut BC drill for people to experience a simulated
            earthquake environment to practice and get prepared in case of the real Earthquake.

                <h4>3D GUI</h4>
                We made the decision to guide audiences in an immersive way that creating a 3D space for them to
                explore.
                Following with the arrow and instructions, the audience get familiar with the basic operations.
                The guide light will lead the audience to the correct position for stepping into the next scene.

            <h4> The VR inside the VR</h4>
            Passing through the guide scene, the audience enters a house and he/she will be guide to the table.
            A VR helmet on the table will bring the audience to another VR game.
            The audience was forced to exist the game and a breaking new pop up to claim that the earthquake is coming.

                When the earthquake ends, the audience needs to find a flashlight in order to find the key in the dark
                environment. As the audience found the key, he/she can escape the house by following the guide light.

        <h4> Issues encountered during the implementation</h4>
        The camera shake we first implemented for simulating the earthquake scene was causing motion sickness to our
        playtesters. 2D GUI is also not appearing on the oculus to provide any information.
    </div>

    <div class="contentReflection">
        <h4>Workarounds, solutions</h4>
        Use animation to animate the whole scene to shake and add rigid-body to each component in the scene to make
        them react to the “physics” during the earthquake scenario. We also made 3D text and glowing signs to guide the
        player around the scenes.

    <div class="contentReflection">
        <h4>Thoughts on final event</h4>
        The event was welcoming to everyone that cross-by and would like to experience virtual reality. Our team is
        happy to see so many people are willing to participate our user study and test our project.
